# MockCache / Ê®°ÊãüÁºìÂ≠ò
MockCache is a project mainly intended for **a basic assessment of my architecture knowledge**. 

Some parts of my implementation or terminologies used may have confict with your cognition, since I've only done a quite shallow study (~3 weeks' self-learning of CS61C) on the relative subjects. Therefore, please read my codes **with caution** üßê.

If you encounter any problem or want to correct my mistakes, just feel free to post in [Issues](https://github.com/ZXPrism/MockCache/issues) üòä!


## Getting Started
I wrote a demo in [demo.cpp](src/demo.cpp).

### Build
- Please make sure you have at least one C++ compiler **supporting C++20** and **set related environment variables correctly**.

- Install [xmake](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake/releases).

- Run command `xmake` under **the project root folder**(i.e. the folder of `xmake.lua`)

  - xmake will automatically install necessary dependencies and build the project
  - Since most dependencies are maintained on GitHub, you may encounter network issues during this step. I believe that you can solve them by yourself.

- You will find the demo binary under folder `bin` (which will be created during building)

### Test
For simplicity, I didn't introduce command arguments in the program. In case you want to modify the settings:

- [CacheBase.h](src/MockCache/CacheBase.h): defines the costs of each operation (currently, only `COST_HIT` and `COST_MISS`)
- [demo.cpp](src/demo.cpp): test settings. I've written many annotations which may help.

..and rebuild the project, of course.


## Project Structure
- `Memory`: simulates a simple flat memory
- `CacheBase`: the base class of a cache, defines basic operations and their costs
- `CacheDirect`: a direct mapped cache implementation
- `CacheFullAssoc`: a fully-associative cache implementation
- `CacheSetAssoc`: a set-associative cache implementation
- `CacheArray`: our test harness, can be loaded with different types of caches for each layer
- `CacheEntry`: namely the cache line, comprises attributes(valid, dirty) and a pointer to the block
- `HitStatus`: stores the result of a cache operation (read / write) and costs
- `ReplacementPolicy`: literally. Used in associative caches.


## Progess
- `2024/10/12`: Basic Architecture + Direct Mapped Cache
- `2024/10/13`: Miscs & ..


## Design Notes
 
This project is merely a "behavioral simulation", so its basic mechansim differs from real caches. For example, associative caches use comparators which work in parallel to find the right cache line with provided tag, but I simply used a hash map.

### Direct Mapped Cache
Easy to implement. There is only one tricky part: since one access request may comprises multiple blocks, we need to divide the address into several segments which belongs to each block, and combine the final result.

My solution is to use a simple two pointers approach for segmentation, then process each segments separately.


### Cache Array
Modern cache often have multiple layers, it's not enough to realize 3 types of caches only, so I introduced the concept of `Cache Array`.

The problem is **interaction**. I need to figure out an efficient and elegant way to organize each layer and let them interact with each other.

Consider we have 3 layers, denoted by L1, L2 and L3.
